# Card Crossed Lovers

This repo was made to show off the C# scripts my team developed for Card Crossed Lovers, a game we developed as part of a week-long game jam organized by the Northeastern and Emerson game development clubs. The game was developed using Unity collab, so there are no commits or contributions here. This repo doesn't have any Unity project files, only scripts. You can find out more about the game here: https://www.willbridgesgames.com/ccl.html
